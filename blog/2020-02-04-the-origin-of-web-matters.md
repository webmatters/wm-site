Web Matters was born from these same principles with the goal of promoting entrepreneurship and leveraging the power of the Web to help people bring their dreams to life.

### Content for entrepreneurs

Hi there! I'm Andy Smith, the founder of Web Matters, a consulting firm with the sole purpose of using the power of the Web to help entrepreneurs launch and grow their businesses. I wanted to take a little time to explain why I created Web Matters and how I hope it will be a vehicle to help entrepreneurs realize their dream of financial independence.

This is not intended to be a sales pitch for our services. Instead, I hope that in reading about my motivations for launching this venture, something will resonate with you that will help you take action toward achieving your own independence.

### If this was my company...

How many times as an employee have you been forced to do something and thought to yourself "This is so stupid. If this was my company…"? In my decades as an employee I said it more times than I can count. Sometimes to myself and often directly to my manager where my advice fell on deaf ears. Later being proven right provided little solace. So much frustration, wasted time, and squandered opportunity.

My experience within companies was that managers are simply trying to survive and it's easier to go along to get along. Above all, they don't want to risk making waves that might jeopardize the almighty paycheck. Never mind that their paycheck is in jeopardy every day from forces completely outside their control.

By no means am I arrogant or foolish enough to think that I'm always right. Having gained excellent experience and education across a range of relevant disciplines though, I've developed a good sense of when to feel confident in my choices, but I lacked the power to act. Over the course of my career I've been responsible for most every area of business involved with product development and generating revenue: software engineering, product management, marketing, market research, business intelligence, sales, and strategic partnerships. As the Farmers' Insurance ad slogan says: "I know a thing or two because I've seen a thing or two.". I couldn't shake the desire to utilize the full range of my experience along with the autonomy to put it into action.

### From hypothetical to reality

In mid-2018, I eventually reached a point where I could no longer keep repeating "If this was my company…". The sentiment each time one of these events occurred had progressed from anger and frustration in the early part of my career to disillusionment in the middle part, eventually transforming into resignation in the latter part. That final transformation into a mode of resigned acceptance is what ultimately woke me up enough to take committed action. That's when I knew that starting my own business was no longer a desire, but a must. I simply needed to chart my own course, make my own decisions, adjusting to feedback along the way, and ultimately living with the results. No other option was possible for me and I was willing to pay any price to make it happen.

This all coincided with the arising of a sense of responsibility to share what I've learned over the years with others who are on the same path. Given the financial commitments in my life, I knew that putting myself in this position would not be easy, but I knew it was possible. Transitioning from being a lifelong "business person" to being a software engineer well into my career, put me in the company of just 0.1% of other developers in terms of age and when they wrote their first line of code. More important, in so doing, I had discovered the simple, but difficult keys to achieving any goal: commitment, focus, and consistent effort. Having made this transformation completely on my own in a highly challenging and demanding field provided the blueprint that I needed to launch my own business.

### Starting up late in life

The conventional wisdom seems to be that being married with two children, a mortgage, two car payments and the rest of the expenses and responsibilities that come with being at this stage of life would make it foolish and selfish to start my own business. That's certainly what I heard from those around me. On the contrary, I've found that with proper planning this is a great time to start a business.

> Why it's great to start a business later in life:

> - You're likely to have generated assets in some form.
> - You've gained a lot of life, business, and management experience.
> - You've developed a large network.

With a little financial preparation, business planning, and family support I was able to go from psychological commitment to officially resigning from my full-time software engineering job to launching Web Matters in a matter of months.

The most difficult challenges were the psychological and social ones because they're so deeply ingrained in our psyches. Most of us have been conditioned to follow a script that involves getting good grades, getting into a good college, getting a good job, working your way up the corporate ladder, hopefully saving enough to retire with 10% of your life left if your health is good enough to enjoy it. As any entrepreneur will tell you, doubts will visit you regularly, but ignore them. They're just echoes of the past.

### The Web Provides Historical Opportunties

My driving motivation for quitting a stable job with a growing company in a growing field was first and foremost my desire for autonomy. However, it coincided with the realization that there has never been a better time than now to start a business. The Web has provided opportunities to successfully launch, run, and market your own business that were not present even a decade ago.

Most business owners are rightfully focused on delivering the core value offered by their business. For most people, it's not a good use of their time to learn ALL of the complexities involved with web design, software development, product strategy, business intelligence, and marketing. I know how challenging it is because I've spent decades doing it. And yet these are keys to being successful in the market as it exists today. It's not usually reasonable in the early stages of a company's lifecycle to hire these resources in-house. Yet acquiring these capabilities has historically required hiring an expensive agency or consulting firm that needs to support the expenses brought about by a large team.

I believe that these transformative technologies, frameworks, and systems should be within reach of EVERY organization. As a result of having developed such broad experience, I feel the desire and the responsibility to offer these same services to entrepreneurs at a reasonable rate. The steep learning curve typically puts these kinds of advantages out of reach for organizations without massive resources behind them. At Web Matters we've already invested the time and resources to overcome that learning curve. As such, we're able and willing to use this knowledge in service of the entrepreneurial and small business community.

### In Closing

My purpose was to share with the community my motivation for launching Web Matters and how we aim to serve you. Hopefully my story provides a little inspiration if you feel like you're stuck in a job that makes you feel controlled, dependent, and ultimately unhappy. For me the break finally occurred when my desire to be an entrepreneur grew into a burning need. This can occur as a result of a single event or when things simply build until a tipping point is reached. Some people are able to work their full-time job and find enough time in the evenings and weekends to make the transformation and then quit their full-time job. I did this for a while, but the progress was too slow and I found it too difficult to maintain the focus required. The key for me was to find a way to provide a 6-month financial cushion to allow myself to focus full-time and ramp up revenue. Then it's all about betting on yourself and working the process every day.

In the future, I'll be providing more direct advice on many of the topics that I glossed over in this article.
